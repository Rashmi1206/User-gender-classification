# User-gender-classification using tweets
I use ensemble modelling to classify between users of twitter based on their tweets. I used "twitter user gender classification" dataset and performed feature selection ,data cleaning and data visualization.
I used three classifiers : 1) Random Forest classifier 2) Extra trees classifier 3) Adaboost classifier and then used voting classifier to combine the prediction of all three classifier
